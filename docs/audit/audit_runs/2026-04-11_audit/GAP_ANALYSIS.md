### Detailed Findings — CRITICAL

---

#### G-OFF-001 — AIM-16 HMM: No Time-Varying Transition Probabilities (TVTP)

**Block:** B1-HMM | **File:** `b1_aim16_hmm.py:104-115` | **Spec:** Doc 22 §2, Doc 32 PG-01C

**Spec requires:** Transition matrix A(x_t) depends on covariates x_t = {VIX_level, day_of_week, prior_session_PnL}. States shift more readily during high-VIX regimes.

**Code implements:** `hmmlearn.hmm.GaussianHMM` with a uniform initial transition matrix (`np.full((3,3), 1/3)`). Baum-Welch learns static transitions. The library does not support covariate-dependent transitions.

**Impact:** HMM opportunity regime detection ignores the market context that should modulate state transitions. Session budget weights (HIGH_OPP gets more allocation) will be less responsive to current market conditions.

**Recommendation:** Implement a custom TVTP layer (e.g., logistic transition model conditioned on covariates), or use a library supporting covariate-dependent HMMs (pomegranate, pyro). Alternatively, post-hoc adjust transition probs using covariate-indexed lookup tables as a pragmatic V1 workaround.

---

#### G-OFF-015 — Pseudotrader Completely Unwired from Orchestrator

**Block:** B3 | **File:** `orchestrator.py` (entire) | **Spec:** Doc 32 PG-09

**Spec requires:** PG-09 triggers on proposed_update events — AIM weight changes, model retrains, strategy injections. It gates parameter commits with a before/after replay comparison.

**Code implements:** The orchestrator has ZERO imports from `b3_pseudotrader.py`. No event (trade outcome, weekly schedule, monthly schedule, injection) dispatches to B3. The only caller is B4 `injection_comparison`, which imports `run_pseudotrader` directly.

**Impact:** Parameter updates (DMA weights, Kelly fractions, EWMA stats) are committed without any pseudotrader validation. There is no safety gate preventing harmful parameter changes from going live.

**Recommendation:** Wire B3 into the orchestrator. At minimum, `run_pseudotrader` should be called before committing D02/D05/D12 updates, with the result gating the commit. For DMA updates (frequent), a fast-path check may be needed to avoid latency.

---

#### G-OFF-016 — No Actual Pipeline Replay in Pseudotrader

**Block:** B3 | **File:** `b3_pseudotrader.py:441-512` | **Spec:** Doc 32 PG-09 Phases 1-2

**Spec requires:** `captain_online_replay(d, using=CURRENT_parameters)` and `captain_online_replay(d, using=PROPOSED_parameters)` — full re-execution of the Online signal pipeline per historical day.

**Code implements:** `run_pseudotrader()` accepts pre-computed `baseline_pnl` and `proposed_pnl` lists. It compares them statistically but never executes the Online pipeline. A separate `run_signal_replay_comparison()` uses `SignalReplayEngine` but is never called from the orchestrator.

**Impact:** Pseudotrader cannot detect parameter interaction effects (e.g., a DMA weight change that alters AIM aggregation, which changes Kelly sizing, which changes signal output). Only direct P&L impact of pre-computed scenarios is tested.

**Recommendation:** Integrate `SignalReplayEngine`-based replay as the primary path. Pre-computed P&L can remain as a fast fallback with appropriate labelling.

---

#### G-OFF-029 — Sensitivity Scanner: Uniform Perturbation Instead of Per-Parameter

**Block:** B5 | **File:** `b5_sensitivity.py:169-177` | **Spec:** Doc 32 PG-12

**Spec requires:** `FOR EACH param p IN base_params: FOR delta IN [...]: perturbed[p] = base_params[p] * (1 + delta)` — each parameter perturbed individually while others stay at base. This produces N_params × 7 grid points.

**Code implements:** Iterates 7 deltas and applies each delta uniformly to ALL SL/TP multipliers simultaneously. Produces only 7 grid points.

**Impact:** Cannot detect if a strategy is fragile to ONE specific parameter while robust to others. A strategy that collapses when SL_mult changes by 5% but is stable for TP_mult changes would test as robust under uniform perturbation.

**Recommendation:** Restructure the perturbation loop to iterate each parameter individually, holding others constant, per the spec's nested FOR loop.

---

#### G-OFF-046 — Version Snapshot: rollback_to_version() Unimplemented

**Block:** Support | **File:** `version_snapshot.py:51-79` | **Spec:** Doc 32 Version Snapshot Policy

**Spec requires:** `rollback_to_version(component_id, version_id, admin_user_id)` that: (1) loads target snapshot from D18, (2) runs pseudotrader comparison, (3) sends HIGH-priority notification for admin approval, (4) snapshots current state before restoring, (5) runs regression tests after rollback, (6) reverts if tests fail, (7) logs to AdminDecisionLog.

**Code implements:** Only `snapshot_before_update()` and `get_latest_version()` exist. No rollback function of any kind.

**Impact:** If a parameter update causes degraded performance, there is no automated way to revert to a known-good state. Manual intervention would be required.

**Recommendation:** Implement `rollback_to_version()` per spec. This requires integration with B3 pseudotrader for comparison, admin notification via alerts, approval workflow, and regression test trigger.

---

### Detailed Findings — HIGH (Selected)

---

#### G-OFF-009/011 — BOCPD/CUSUM State Not Persisted; Lost on Restart

**Block:** B2 | **Files:** `b2_bocpd.py:142-156`, `orchestrator.py:51` | **Spec:** Doc 32 PG-05

The BOCPD `to_dict()` only stores `cp_probability` and `cp_history` — not the full `run_length_posterior` or per-run-length NIG sufficient statistics. The QuestDB schema has a `bocpd_run_length_posterior` column that is never written. On process restart, all BOCPD/CUSUM detectors start fresh with default priors. The `from_dict()` deserializers exist but are never called by the orchestrator's startup. This means changepoint detection accuracy degrades after every restart until the detector re-converges.

---

#### G-OFF-010 — S2-19: CUSUM Bootstrap Calibration Missing at Init

**Block:** B2 | **File:** `b2_cusum.py`, `orchestrator.py` | **Spec:** Doc 32 PG-07

Spec requires calibration at init AND quarterly. Quarterly is implemented (`_run_quarterly`). Init-time calibration is NOT implemented. After fresh bootstrap, `sequential_limits` is empty and the CUSUM detector falls back to `default_limit=5.0` for all sprint lengths. This hardcoded limit may be too loose or too tight depending on the asset's volatility.

---

#### G-OFF-021 — G-025 CB Pseudotrader Still Not Account-Aware

**Block:** B3 | **File:** `b3_pseudotrader.py:619-755` | **Spec:** Doc 32 PG-09B

The prior audit flagged this as G-025 HIGH and deferred it via DEC-04. It remains unresolved. `run_cb_pseudotrader()` replays trades with/without CB layers but ignores DLL, MDD, scaling tiers, trading hours, and all other account constraints. The CB replay operates purely on CB parameters with no `account_config` input.

---

#### G-OFF-039 — Kelly Shrinkage Uses 1/√N Proxy

**Block:** B8 | **File:** `b8_kelly_update.py:108-116` | **Spec:** Doc 32 PG-15:664-666, Doc 21 L3

Spec: `shrinkage = max(0.3, 1.0 - compute_estimation_variance(P3-D05[u]))`. Code: `shrinkage = max(0.3, 1.0 - 1.0/sqrt(n_trades))`. The 1/√N proxy always produces the same shrinkage for a given N regardless of data noise. A volatile asset with 200 trades gets the same shrinkage as a stable one. This affects position sizing accuracy.

---

#### G-OFF-040/041 — CB Params: L_star Missing and cold_start Not Written

**Block:** B8 | **File:** `b8_cb_params.py:134-207` | **Spec:** Doc 32 PG-16C:686-715

L_star = -r̄/β_b (breakeven loss level) is not computed or stored. This is the threshold telling the circuit breaker at what cumulative loss the expected next-trade return turns negative. Without it, CB Layer 3 cannot make informed blocking decisions. Additionally, the `cold_start` boolean is missing from D25 writes, and the spec's two-tier threshold (n<10 skip entirely, 10≤n<100 cold_start=true) is collapsed to a single n<100 threshold.

---

#### G-OFF-049 — Bootstrap Does Not Initialize D02 (aim_meta_weights)

**Block:** Support | **File:** `bootstrap.py:80-211` | **Spec:** Doc 32 PG-02

The bootstrap initializes D05 (EWMA), D04 (decay), D12 (Kelly), D01 (AIM statuses) but NOT D02 (aim_meta_weights / inclusion probabilities). The DMA update (PG-02) requires existing D02 rows to apply the forgetting factor. Without D02 seeding, the first DMA update after bootstrap will either fail or produce undefined behavior.

---

### Detailed Findings — CRITICAL

#### G-ONL-017 — Kelly L4 Robust Fallback Formula Algebraically Wrong

**Block:** B4 | **File:** `b4_kelly_sizing.py:132-141` | **Spec:** Doc 33 PG-24 L4, Doc 21 Part 3

**Spec requires:** `f_robust = mu / (mu^2 + var) IF mu > 0 ELSE 0` — a standard mean-variance Kelly approximation that fires when `regime_uncertain[u]` is true.

**Code implements:** Delegates to `compute_robust_kelly` in `b1_features.py:468-481` which computes return bounds `(mu - 1.5*sigma, mu + 1.5*sigma)` then `f_robust = lower / (upper * lower)`. This simplifies algebraically to `1/upper`, which is a distributional-robust min-max approach — an entirely different formula.

**Impact:** During regime uncertainty (the exact scenario where this fallback fires), the two formulas produce substantially different Kelly fractions. For a typical `mu=0.02, sigma=0.05`: spec yields `f_robust = 0.02/(0.0004+0.0025) = 6.9`, code yields `1/(0.02+0.075) = 10.5` — a 52% oversize. Position sizing is directly affected.

**Recommendation:** Replace the robust formula with the spec's `mu / (mu^2 + var)` or document the intentional deviation with DEC-XX.

---

#### G-ONL-028 — Prohibited Fields Leak Through GUI WebSocket

**Block:** B6 | **File:** `b6_signal_output.py:94-134` | **Spec:** Doc 20 PG-26, `shared/constants.py` PROHIBITED_EXTERNAL_FIELDS

**Spec requires:** Signal output limited to 6 fields: `asset, direction, size, TP, SL, timestamp`. PROHIBITED_EXTERNAL_FIELDS must never appear in external-facing signals.

**Code implements:** B6 publishes ~30 fields to Redis including `aim_breakdown`, `regime_probs`, `combined_modifier`, `expected_edge`, `win_rate`, `payoff_ratio` — all prohibited. Command B1's `sanitise_for_api()` correctly strips these for the API adapter, but `gui_push_fn` at `b1_core_routing.py:78-81` pushes the full unsanitized blob to the GUI WebSocket.

**Impact:** Any user with GUI access can see the system's internal signal reasoning — AIM weights, regime probabilities, Kelly edge. In multi-user deployment, this leaks proprietary trading intelligence. The sanitization boundary is deferred to Command rather than enforced at source.

**Recommendation:** Apply field sanitization in B6 before Redis publish, or add a separate sanitization step in Command B1's `gui_push_fn` path.

---

#### G-ONL-042 — Capacity Evaluation Implements Entirely Different Algorithm

**Block:** B9 | **File:** `b9_capacity_evaluation.py:26-162` | **Spec:** Doc 33 PG-29

**Spec requires:** Per-asset fill slippage analysis: compare actual fill prices to expected signal prices, compute `fill_quality`, `slippage_bps`, `avg_fill_time`, `fill_rate`, `volume_participation`. Alert when `slippage_bps > threshold`.

**Code implements:** A multi-user capacity planning model based on signal supply/demand ratios, quality pass rates, correlation-adjusted diversity, and strategy homogeneity. None of the five spec metrics (slippage_bps, avg_fill_time, fill_rate, volume_participation, fill_quality) exist in the code. The code never reads trade fill data or signal prices.

**Impact:** No empirical fill quality monitoring exists. If market microstructure degrades (slippage increases), the system has no way to detect or alert. The implemented model serves a different purpose (multi-user capacity planning) that is useful but does not replace the spec's fill quality monitoring.

**Recommendation:** Implement the spec's PG-29 fill analysis as a separate function alongside the existing capacity planning. Both serve valid but different purposes.

### Detailed Findings — HIGH (Selected)

---

#### G-ONL-004/005/006 — Three AIMs Data-Starved by Hard Stubs

**Block:** B1-Features | **Files:** `b1_features.py:863,965-972,938` | **Spec:** Doc 33 PG-21 §4

Three feature data source functions are permanently stubbed returning None: `_get_overnight_range` (AIM-01 vrp_overnight), `_get_options_volume`/`_get_put_iv`/`_get_option_chain` (AIM-02 pcr/put_skew, AIM-03 gex), and `_get_trailing_pcr` (AIM-02 pcr_z). These AIMs may have ACTIVE status in D01 but produce zero useful signal. The AIM aggregation handles None gracefully (neutral modifier), so no wrong trades result, but three intelligence modules contribute nothing.

---

#### G-ONL-024 — CB L2 Uses Trade-Count Budget Instead of Dollar Budget

**Block:** B5C | **File:** `b5c_circuit_breaker.py:296-325` | **Spec:** Doc 33 PG-27B L2

Spec: `remaining_budget = E - |L_t|; IF remaining < rho_j → BLOCK`. Code: `IF n_t >= N → BLOCK` where `N = floor((e*A)/(MDD*p+phi))`. A trade-count ceiling cannot detect that a single large-rho_j signal exceeds the dollar budget when total trade count is still under N. Conversely, it may block small signals when count hits N even though dollar budget remains.

---

#### G-ONL-030 — Anti-Copy Jitter Completely Missing

**Block:** B6 | **File:** `b6_signal_output.py` (whole) | **Spec:** Doc 20 PG-26

Spec: `time_jitter = random_uniform(-30, +30) seconds; size_jitter = random_choice([-1, 0, +1]) micros`. Grep across entire codebase confirms zero matches for "jitter", "anti_copy", or related patterns. This is required for multi-instance deployment to avoid prop firm copy-trading detection. Single-instance V1 is unaffected.

---

#### G-ONL-032 — Position Monitor Time-Exit Uses Naive datetime

**Block:** B7 | **File:** `b7_position_monitor.py:134` | **Spec:** CLAUDE.md timezone rule

Time-exit forced close uses `datetime.now()` without timezone. During DST transitions (spring forward/fall back), naive datetime could be off by 1 hour, causing premature or late forced exits. All other time-critical logic in the Online process uses `ZoneInfo("America/New_York")`.

---

### Key Validated Areas

The following spec requirements were verified as correctly implemented:

**B1 — Data Ingestion:**
- Contract rollover: `roll_confirmed` flag, `ROLL_PENDING` status, CRITICAL alert for ≤0 days, HIGH for ≤3 days (S2-22 **satisfied**)
- Price bounds: 5% threshold → `PRICE_SUSPECT` + `DATA_HOLD` + D21 incident
- Session matching: SESSION_IDS constant (1=NY, 2=LON, 3=APAC) with fallback
- Feature list completeness: all 20+ spec features mapped in AIM_FEATURE_MAP across 16 AIMs
- IVTS (VIX/VXV): always computed regardless of AIM-04 status as CRITICAL regime filter
- Correlation z-score: rolling 20d with dynamic asset pairs, trailing 252d baseline
- Cross-asset momentum: MACD(12,26,9) with 21-day lookback
- Offline data loading: D01, D02, D05, D08, D12 all correctly loaded with dedup

**B2 — Regime Probability:**
- `regime_uncertain` threshold at strict `< 0.6` (not ≤0.6) — matches spec
- BINARY_THRESHOLD classifier branch exists and returns correct probabilities
- S2-05: AIM-05 (Order Book) deferred status correctly returns modifier=1.0, confidence=0.0

**B3 — AIM Aggregation:**
- MoE weighted aggregation: `sum(m_i * w_i) / sum(w_i)` with fallback to 1.0 — correct
- `combined_modifier` clamped to [0.5, 1.5] via MODIFIER_FLOOR/CEILING constants
- `aim_breakdown` stored per asset and passed through orchestrator to B7 for learning loop

**B4 — Kelly Sizing:**
- L2 blended Kelly: regime-weighted sum across LOW_VOL/HIGH_VOL — correct
- L3 shrinkage: multiplication by shrinkage_factor — correct
- L5 AIM modifier: multiplication by combined_modifier — correct
- L6 account adjustment: pass_prob thresholds (0.5→0.5, 0.7→0.7, else→0.85), PRESERVE_CAPITAL→0.5 — all correct
- L7 TSM: MDD cap, MLL cap, max_contracts, XFA scaling cap, fee in risk_per_contract — all present

**B5 — Trade Selection:**
- Signal ranking by edge × contracts: correct sorting
- HMM session allocation: cold-start ramp (<20 equal, 20-59 blended, 60+ full HMM), 0.05 floor

**B5C — Circuit Breaker:**
- L0 scaling cap: XFA-only guard with micro_equivalent comparison — correct
- L1 preemptive halt: `rho_j = contracts * (sl_distance * pv + fee)`, halt check — correct
- L3 beta_b expectancy: `mu_b = r_bar + beta_b * L_t`, block if ≤0 — correct

**B6 — Signal Output:**
- S2-04 priority rotation correctly deferred for V1 single-user
- Direction-zero safety guard prevents publishing directionless signals
- TP/SL ORB computation: `tp_multiple * or_range` and `sl_multiple * or_range` — correct

**B7 — Position Monitor:**
- D03 outcome includes aim_breakdown_at_entry from Block 3 cache
- D23 L_t and n_t updated atomically on trade close
- Commission resolution: 4-source chain (API, fee_schedule, per_contract, zero fallback)
- Redis publish to `stream:trade_outcomes` with 3-attempt exponential backoff retry

**B7-Shadow — Shadow Monitor:**
- Registers all signals as shadows, removes on TAKEN — correct Category A learning flow
- Publishes theoretical outcomes with `theoretical=True` flag for Offline shared intelligence

**B8 — Concentration + OR Tracker:**
- 80% concentration threshold matches spec (DEFAULT_CONCENTRATION_THRESHOLD=0.8)
- Advisory only — does not block execution
- OR Tracker: proper ET timezone, thread-safe with Lock, complete state machine (WAITING→FORMING→COMPLETE→BREAKOUT/EXPIRED)

**Orchestrator:**
- B1-B3 SHARED computed once per session before per-user loop — correct
- B4-B9 PER-USER iterates over active users — correct
- Session-driven dispatch via session_registry.json with dedup guard
- Redis Stream consumer for commands channel with ACK and exponential backoff

**S2-Flagged Item Resolution:**
- S2-04: Signal Distribution priority rotation → correctly deferred for V1 (**VALID**)
- S2-05: AIM-05 deferred → modifier=1.0, confidence=0.0 (**VALID**)
- S2-15: AIM cascade ordering → no explicit cascade; currently no inter-AIM deps (**G-ONL-014 MEDIUM**)
- S2-22: Contract rollover roll_confirmed → fully implemented (**VALID**)

### Detailed Findings — CRITICAL

#### G-CMD-001 — No RBAC Enforcement Anywhere in API

**Spec:** Doc 19 §4 defines 6 roles (ADMIN, ANALYST/DEV, TRADER, VIEWER, SYSTEM, AUDITOR) with tag-based permissions. ADMIN gets full control; VIEWER is read-only; AUDITOR gets read logs with no mutating actions.

**Code:** `api.py:113-142` — JWT middleware extracts `sub` (user_id) from the token and stores it in `request.state`, but the JWT payload (`api.py:299-303`) contains only `sub`, `iat`, and `exp` — no `roles` or `tags` field. Endpoints like `/api/system-overview` (line 592) and `/api/aim/{aim_id}/activate` (line 571) have comments saying "ADMIN only" but zero enforcement code exists. Any authenticated user can: activate/deactivate AIMs, view system overview, modify notification preferences, start replays, and access all endpoints indiscriminately.

**Impact:** In V2 multi-user deployment, a VIEWER-role user could activate/deactivate AIMs or trigger diagnostics. Even in V1, the complete absence of role infrastructure means adding RBAC later requires changes across every endpoint.

#### G-CMD-002 — RPT-12 Alpha Decomposition Completely Missing

**Spec:** Doc 29 §2.5 defines 12 reports (RPT-01 through RPT-12). RPT-12 "Alpha Decomposition" should decompose PnL into: base strategy contribution, regime conditioning, AIM modifiers, and Kelly sizing effects. Sources: P3-D03, D02, D05, D12. Trigger: monthly / on-demand.

**Code:** `b6_reports.py:32-44` — `REPORT_TYPES` registry contains only 11 entries (RPT-01 through RPT-11). Module docstring at line 9 says "11 report types." The `generators` dict at lines 76-88 has no RPT-12 entry. No alpha decomposition function exists anywhere in the codebase.

**Impact:** The system cannot attribute returns to its component strategies. Without alpha decomposition, it is impossible to determine whether AIM modifiers, regime conditioning, or the base strategy drive performance — critical for model validation (Doc 29 Part 3).

#### G-CMD-003 — B10 Data Validation Missing Continuous Monitoring

**Spec:** Doc 34 PG-41 requires continuous validation of incoming data streams checking: (1) freshness via max_staleness threshold → P3_MEDIUM incident, (2) completeness via required_fields → P2_HIGH incident, (3) format via schema validation → P2_HIGH incident.

**Code:** `b10_data_validation.py` validates user-submitted data (entry price, commission, balance) and asset configs. There is zero data feed freshness checking, no staleness timer, no monitoring loop, and no call to `create_incident()` anywhere in the file. The block does not import B9 incident response.

**Impact:** Stale market data, missing feed fields, or corrupted schemas will not be detected until they cause downstream signal errors. The system has no automated data quality defense.

#### G-CMD-004 — B8 Balance Mismatch Not Recorded as Incident

**Spec:** Doc 34 PG-39 step 1: if `abs(broker_balance - system_balance) > reconciliation_threshold`, call `create_incident("RECONCILIATION", "P2_HIGH", "FINANCE", "Balance mismatch for {ac}...")`.

**Code:** `b8_reconciliation.py:109-111` pushes a GUI notification with priority "MEDIUM" and logs the correction, but never calls `create_incident()`. The B9 module is not imported. The mismatch is auto-corrected (broker = source of truth) without creating an auditable incident record in P3-D21.

**Impact:** Balance mismatches — which could indicate unauthorized trades, API errors, or accounting bugs — leave no formal incident trail. ADMIN cannot review historical reconciliation failures.

### Detailed Findings — HIGH (Selected)

#### G-CMD-005 — Hardcoded "primary_user" Breaks Multi-User Isolation

**Code:** `api.py` has 13 instances of hardcoded `"primary_user"` across lines 281, 557, 574, 584, 784, 790, 803, 830, 849, 873, 919, 926, 983. Examples: `api_aim_activate` (line 574) hardcodes `user_id: "primary_user"` instead of reading from JWT `request.state.user_id`; replay endpoints (lines 803, 926) use hardcoded user_id in SQL queries. **Spec (Doc 19 §7):** P3-D16 capital silos must isolate per-user.

#### G-CMD-009/018/019 — Compliance Gate Missing Per-Signal Checks

**Code:** B12 (`b12_compliance_gate.py`) checks 11 RTS6 boolean flags and `AUTO_EXECUTE` env var — a global gate status. B3 (`b3_api_adapter.py:468-471`) delegates to B12. Neither checks `signal.contracts > max_contracts` nor `instrument_permitted(signal.asset)` as spec requires. B4 (`b4_tsm_manager.py:243-246`) caps contracts at `max_contracts` but doesn't reject with the spec-mandated `{approved: False, reason: "EXCEEDS_MAX_CONTRACTS"}` format.

#### G-CMD-012 — SQL Placeholder Syntax Crash in B7 Role Queries

**Code:** `b7_notifications.py:449` builds `$1, $2, ...` PostgreSQL-style positional placeholders, but QuestDB via psycopg2 uses `%s` placeholders (as used everywhere else in the codebase). Any call to `_get_users_by_roles` for non-TRADER roles will raise a database error, meaning ADMIN/DEV/RISK notifications are undeliverable.

#### G-CMD-015 — No Incident Escalation Matrix

**Spec:** Doc 29 §2.4: P1 acknowledged within 5 minutes, P2 within 30 minutes, P3 within 4 hours, P4 next business day. **Code:** B9 creates incidents as OPEN and supports manual resolution, but has no timers, no acknowledgement tracking, no auto-escalation on timeout. Unacknowledged P1 incidents will never auto-notify additional responders.

### S2-Flagged Items Resolution

| S2-ID | Finding | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| S2-06 | RPT-12 Alpha Decomposition | **GAP CONFIRMED (G-CMD-002 CRITICAL)**: Missing entirely. Only 11 of 12 reports exist. |
| S2-07 | P3-D16 capital_silos per-user isolation | **GAP CONFIRMED (G-CMD-005 HIGH)**: api.py hardcodes "primary_user" in 13 locations; no per-user scoping from JWT. |
| S2-09 | RBAC 6 roles | **GAP CONFIRMED (G-CMD-001 CRITICAL)**: JWT has no roles field; zero enforcement across all endpoints. |
| S2-10 | Quiet hours 22:00-06:00 with CRITICAL override | **VALID**: b7_notifications.py:98-100 defaults 22:00-06:00 local TZ. Line 266 checks `priority != "CRITICAL"` for quiet hours bypass. Correctly implemented. |
| S2-11 | Per-user notification preferences | **VALID**: b7_notifications.py:88-105 includes channel toggles (telegram/email/push), priority threshold, asset filters (allowlist), sound per priority. All spec preference types present. |
| S2-12 | Compliance gate completeness | **GAP CONFIRMED (G-CMD-009/018/019 HIGH)**: B12 checks global flags only; no instrument_permitted or max_contracts per-signal checks. |
| S2-13 | XFA scaling tiers end-of-day | **PARTIAL GAP (G-CMD-013 HIGH)**: B4 has correct 5-tier lookup table; B8 gates evaluation on `topstep_optimisation` instead of `scaling_plan_active`. |
| S2-14 | Payout recommendation logic | **PARTIAL GAP (G-CMD-040 MEDIUM)**: XFA $5k/50% cap and 10% commission implemented; 5 winning days requirement missing for XFA accounts. |
| S2-16 | Health endpoint with 30s monitoring | **MOSTLY VALID (G-CMD-046 MEDIUM)**: 7/7 required fields present; 30s health check schedule confirmed; overall status never returns "HALTED" even when CB is halted. |
| S2-21 | Incident escalation matrix | **GAP CONFIRMED (G-CMD-015 HIGH)**: No escalation timers, acknowledgement tracking, or auto-escalation. |

### Key Validated Areas

**V-CMD-001 | B1 | 6-field sanitisation:** `sanitise_for_api()` returns exactly 6 fields (asset, direction, size, tp, sl, timestamp) via whitelist. PROHIBITED_EXTERNAL_FIELDS constant in `shared/constants.py` matches spec's 9 prohibited fields.

**V-CMD-002 | B1 | 13+ command types handled:** `route_command()` dispatches all spec command types: TAKEN/SKIPPED (combined), ADOPT_STRATEGY, REJECT_STRATEGY, PARALLEL_TRACK, SELECT_TSM, ACTIVATE_AIM, DEACTIVATE_AIM, CONFIRM_ROLL, UPDATE_ACTION_ITEM, TRIGGER_DIAGNOSTIC, MANUAL_PAUSE, MANUAL_RESUME. Plus extensions: CONCENTRATION_PROCEED, CONCENTRATION_PAUSE.

**V-CMD-003 | B1 | Notification logging to D10:** `_log_notification()` inserts to `p3_d10_notification_log`. Telegram routing fires for CRITICAL and HIGH priority.

**V-CMD-004 | B1 | Broadcast to all users:** `route_notification()` calls `_get_all_active_user_ids()` when `user_id` absent, correctly broadcasting system alerts.

**V-CMD-005 | B2 | Payout panel:** `_get_payout_panel()` implements per-account recommended payout with net-after-commission and tier impact, matching Doc 18 §6.

**V-CMD-006 | B2 | 8-dimension diagnostics:** `_get_diagnostic_health()` queries P3-D22 for all 8 system health dimensions per PG-17.

**V-CMD-007 | B2 | Thread-safe snapshot:** `_state_lock` and atomic snapshot pattern protect mutable state for concurrent GUI clients.

**V-CMD-008 | B3 | Adapter interface:** ABC with 5 lifecycle methods (connect, send_signal, receive_fill, get_account_status, disconnect) plus ping. TopstepX concrete adapter with bracket order placement.

**V-CMD-009 | B3 | 30s health check with 3-retry reconnect:** Matches spec's auto-reconnect requirement.

**V-CMD-010 | B3 | 4-field inbound boundary:** balance, equity, drawdown, open_positions — information from broker correctly restricted.

**V-CMD-011 | B4 | TSM validation:** Required fields, classification block, numeric sanity, V3 fee_schedule with per-instrument fees.

**V-CMD-012 | B4 | Scaling tier lookup:** `get_scaling_tier()` implements correct 5-tier balance-threshold lookup matching Doc 25 table.

**V-CMD-013 | B5 | Injection flow end-to-end:** Receives candidate from Offline B4 via D06 query, presents to user via GUI push, captures ADOPT/PARALLEL_TRACK/REJECT, forwards to Offline via Redis CH_COMMANDS.

**V-CMD-014 | B6 | RPT-04 (AIM Effectiveness):** Fully implemented with DMA weights, modifier accuracy, PnL contribution, and days suppressed.

**V-CMD-015 | B6 | RPT-07 (TSM Compliance):** Computes drawdown vs MDD, budget remaining, pass probability.

**V-CMD-016 | B7 | Quiet hours with CRITICAL override:** 22:00-06:00 local TZ, CRITICAL bypasses, queue capped at 50 with FIFO eviction.

**V-CMD-017 | B7 | Per-user preferences:** Channel toggles, priority threshold, asset filters, sound per priority all implemented.

**V-CMD-018 | B7 | Rate limit 60/hr:** Enforced in telegram_bot.py per chat.

**V-CMD-019 | B8 | SOD formulas correct:** f(A)=4500/A, R_eff=(4500p+phi)/A, N=floor(eA/(4500p+phi)), E=eA, L_halt=ceA all match spec.

**V-CMD-020 | B8 | Broker balance as source of truth:** Auto-corrects system balance to match broker on mismatch.

**V-CMD-021 | B8 | Reconciliation logged to D19:** Correct data store write.

**V-CMD-022 | B9 | Incident persistence to D21:** UUID-based ID, severity validation, OPEN status, resolution flow all correct.

**V-CMD-023 | telegram | 7 commands implemented:** /status, /signals, /positions, /reports, /tsm, /mute, /help.

**V-CMD-024 | telegram | Inline TAKEN/SKIPPED buttons:** On signal notifications, callback validation for action type.

**V-CMD-025 | telegram | Security controls:** Chat ID whitelist from D16, bot token from vault, no strategy details in messages, CRITICAL bypasses mute.

**V-CMD-026 | orch | Parity filter:** `_check_parity_skip` correctly implements INSTANCE_PARITY with daily Redis counter and deterministic trade splitting.

**V-CMD-027 | orch | Always-on architecture:** 4 threads (signal reader, Redis listener, log forwarder, scheduler) with exponential backoff.

**V-CMD-028 | api.py | Health endpoint fields:** All 7 required fields present: status, uptime_seconds, last_signal_time, active_users, circuit_breaker, api_connections, last_heartbeat.

**V-CMD-029 | api.py | JWT authentication:** HS256 signing, 24h expiry, middleware validation on all non-exempt paths, WebSocket JWT verification.

**V-CMD-030 | api.py | WebSocket per-user scoping:** Sessions tracked per-user; dashboard pushes per-user.

**V-CMD-031 | api.py | Graceful shutdown:** FastAPI lifespan stops orchestrator and Telegram bot on SIGTERM/SIGINT.

**V-CMD-032 | main.py | Initialization sequence:** QuestDB+Redis verify → TSM load → Telegram bot → chat_id to D16 → TopstepX auth → TSM link → orchestrator thread → uvicorn main thread.

**V-CMD-033 | B12 | RTS6 gate:** All 11 flags checked with fail-safe default to MANUAL mode. AUTO_EXECUTE env var required.

### Key Validated Areas

**redis_client.py:** All 5 spec channels defined (CH_SIGNALS template, CH_TRADE_OUTCOMES, CH_COMMANDS, CH_ALERTS, CH_STATUS). Singleton with double-checked locking. Redis Streams (XADD/XREAD) alongside pub/sub with maxlen=1000 cap. Idempotent consumer group creation.

**questdb_client.py:** Environment-based config. Context manager with auto-commit. LATEST ON used correctly in read_d00_row. Parameterized queries (%s). D00_COLUMNS matches schema.

**contract_resolver.py:** All 10 assets mapped (ES, MES, NQ, MNQ, M2K, MYM, NKD, MGC, ZB, ZN). 4-tier resolution chain (cache→config→D00→API). Thread-safe cache with Lock. LATEST ON in D00 fallback.

**account_lifecycle.py:** All monetary constants match spec (EVAL_MLL=$4,500, profit target=$9,000, XFA_MLL=$4,500). Correct 5-tier XFA scaling. LIVE daily DD, low-balance threshold, capital unlock at $9K blocks. Payout commission 10% XFA / 0% LIVE. Account failure + $226.60 fee.

**vault.py:** AES-256-GCM confirmed. PBKDF2HMAC SHA256 with 600K iterations (OWASP 2023). Master key from env var only. Random 12-byte nonce. Per-account key storage.

**journal.py:** SQLite WAL mode. write_checkpoint/get_last_checkpoint functions correct. Auto-init with CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS. Per-process journal paths via env var.

### Detailed Findings — CRITICAL

---

#### G-XCT-012 — Crash Recovery Journal Is Write-Only Across All 3 Processes

**Files:** `captain-offline/main.py:129-132`, `captain-online/main.py:107-110`, `captain-command/main.py:305-308`
**Spec:** Doc 33 crash recovery, Doc 32 version snapshot policy

All 3 processes diligently write checkpoints throughout execution (60+ `write_checkpoint()` calls codebase-wide). On startup, all 3 call `get_last_checkpoint(ROLE)`, log the result ("Resuming from: X — next: Y"), and then proceed with normal initialization — completely ignoring the checkpoint state and next_action field.

**Example (captain-online/main.py:107-110):**
```python
last = get_last_checkpoint(ROLE)
if last:
    logger.info(f"Resuming from: {last['checkpoint']} — next: {last.get('next_action','fresh')}")
# ... proceeds with full fresh startup regardless
```

If Online crashes mid-session with checkpoint "STREAMS_STARTED", it restarts streams from scratch. If Offline crashes after "WEEKLY_START" with next_action "run_sensitivity", the sensitivity scan is never resumed.

**Impact:** No crash recovery exists in practice. The journal infrastructure is complete but the recovery logic is missing. Mid-session crashes require a full restart from scratch, potentially re-processing already-completed work or missing partially-completed learning updates.

---

#### G-XCT-015 — GUI WebSocket Bypasses PROHIBITED_FIELDS Sanitization

**Files:** `captain-online/b6_signal_output.py:94-136` → Redis → `captain-command/b1_core_routing.py:80-82` → WebSocket
**Spec:** Doc 20 PG-26, `shared/constants.py` PROHIBITED_EXTERNAL_FIELDS

The signal flow has two outbound paths:
1. **API Adapter path:** B6 → Redis → Command B1 → `sanitise_for_api()` → B3 → Brokerage. **Correct: 6 fields only.**
2. **GUI WebSocket path:** B6 → Redis → Command B1 → `gui_push_fn(signal)` → WebSocket → Browser. **Bypassed: all ~30 fields including aim_breakdown, regime_probs, combined_modifier, expected_edge.**

Any user with browser DevTools can inspect the WebSocket messages and see the system's internal signal reasoning. In multi-user/multi-instance deployment, this leaks proprietary trading intelligence (AIM weights, Kelly parameters, regime probabilities) to any connected client.

**Recommendation:** Add `sanitise_for_api(signal)` call in `gui_push_fn` path at `b1_core_routing.py:80`, or create a separate GUI-safe field set that excludes PROHIBITED fields while allowing display-relevant extras.

## Final Rollup

| Program | GAP | VALID | AMENDED | BLOCKED | CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW |
|---------|-----|-------|---------|---------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| P3-Offline | 51 | ~75 | 4 | 0 | 4 | 20 | 22 | 5 |
| P3-Online | 49 | ~40 | 8 | 0 | 3 | 14 | 22 | 10 |
| P3-Command | 64 | ~35 | 4 | 0 | 3 | 15 | 31 | 18 |
| Shared Modules | 22 | 41 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 12 | 5 |
| Cross-Cutting | 16 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 6 | 2 |
| **TOTAL** | **202** | **~195** | **18** | **0** | **12** | **60** | **93** | **40** |

**Note:** Cross-cutting findings (G-XCT-xxx) overlap with per-program findings (the same underlying issue surfaces in multiple programs). The per-program findings provide the granular detail; cross-cutting findings identify the systemic pattern. De-duplicated unique gap count is approximately **186** (removing ~16 cross-cutting entries that are aggregations of per-program findings).

**Post-audit decisions:** DEC-11 (defer HMM TVTP) and DEC-12 (defer RBAC) reclassified G-OFF-001 and G-CMD-001 from CRITICAL GAP to AMENDED, reducing active CRITICALs from 14 to 12.

## Overall Verdict: NOT READY

**The Captain System is NOT READY for live trading.**

### Justification

**12 CRITICAL gaps** remain across the system (down from 14 after DEC-11/DEC-12 deferrals). Any single CRITICAL finding could produce wrong trades, lose money, or crash the system in production:

1. **Position sizing errors (2 CRITICAL):**
   - G-ONL-017: Kelly L4 robust formula algebraically wrong — 52% oversize during regime uncertainty
   - G-OFF-029: Sensitivity scanner applies uniform perturbation instead of per-parameter — cannot detect single-parameter fragility

2. **Safety gates missing (3 CRITICAL):**
   - G-OFF-015/016: Pseudotrader completely unwired from orchestrator AND uses pre-computed P&L instead of actual pipeline replay — parameter updates committed without validation
   - G-XCT-012: Crash recovery journal write-only — all 3 processes ignore checkpoint state on restart

3. **Data integrity (3 CRITICAL):**
   - G-CMD-004: Balance mismatch auto-corrected without incident record — unauthorized trades or API errors leave no audit trail
   - G-CMD-003: No continuous data feed monitoring — stale/corrupt market data undetected until downstream signal errors
   - G-ONL-042: Capacity evaluation implements entirely different algorithm — no empirical fill quality monitoring exists

4. **Information leakage (1 CRITICAL):**
   - G-ONL-028 / G-XCT-015: Prohibited fields (aim_breakdown, regime_probs, Kelly params) leak through GUI WebSocket — proprietary strategy visible in browser DevTools

5. **Operational gaps (3 CRITICAL):**
   - G-CMD-002: RPT-12 Alpha Decomposition missing — cannot attribute returns to component strategies
   - G-OFF-046: Version rollback entirely unimplemented — no automated revert to known-good parameters

### What Works (Production-Ready Areas)

Despite the CRITICAL gaps, substantial portions of the system are correctly implemented:

- **Core signal pipeline (B1-B3):** Data ingestion, regime detection, AIM aggregation all produce correct signals per spec
- **Kelly sizing (L1-L3, L5-L7):** 6 of 7 Kelly layers correct; only L4 robust fallback is wrong
- **Circuit breaker (L0, L1, L3):** Preemptive halt, beta_b expectancy checks work; L2/L4 use different formulas
- **Feedback loops (1-6):** AIM meta-learning, decay detection, Kelly EWMA, beta_b learning, intraday CB state, SOD compounding all correctly wired end-to-end
- **Infrastructure:** Redis Streams with consumer groups, QuestDB with proper LATEST ON in core paths, Docker multi-container orchestration, JWT authentication, Telegram bot
- **Account lifecycle:** Monetary constants, scaling tiers, payout rules, progression logic all match spec
- **Reconciliation formulas:** f(A), R_eff, N, E, L_halt all mathematically correct

### Minimum Path to READY

To reach READY status, the following 12 CRITICAL gaps must be resolved (in priority order).
DEC-11 (HMM TVTP) and DEC-12 (RBAC) are deferred — not in this list.
DEC-04 (pseudotrader post-live) is **REVOKED** — pseudotrader wiring is now mandatory.

| Priority | Finding | Effort | Risk if Deferred |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | G-ONL-017: Fix Kelly L4 robust formula | Small (formula swap) | Wrong position sizes during uncertainty |
| 2 | G-ONL-028/G-XCT-015: Sanitize GUI WebSocket path | Small (add sanitise call) | Strategy leakage to all GUI users |
| 3 | G-OFF-015/016: Wire pseudotrader into orchestrator + use SignalReplayEngine | Medium-Large | Parameter updates unvalidated — system self-modifies with no safety net |
| 4 | G-ONL-042: Implement fill slippage monitoring alongside capacity model | Medium | Slippage invisible until P&L erodes |
| 5 | G-CMD-004: Add create_incident for balance mismatch | Small | No audit trail for mismatches |
| 6 | G-CMD-003: Add data feed freshness monitoring | Medium | Stale data → wrong signals |
| 7 | G-XCT-012: Implement crash recovery branching | Medium | Full restart on every crash |
| 8 | G-OFF-029: Fix sensitivity per-parameter perturbation | Small (loop restructure) | Cannot detect per-param fragility |
| 9 | G-CMD-002: Implement RPT-12 Alpha Decomposition | Medium | Cannot attribute returns |
| 10 | G-OFF-046: Implement rollback_to_version | Large | No automated parameter revert |

Items 1-2 are quick fixes (<1 hour). Items 3-4 are the highest-priority medium efforts (pseudotrader + fill monitoring). Items 5-7 complete the safety layer. Items 8-10 round out operational completeness.

### BLOCKED Items Requiring Isaac's Input

None. All findings could be traced to clear spec requirements. No ambiguity requiring spec author clarification.

### Architectural Decisions Recorded

| DEC-ID | Finding | Decision | Rationale | Date |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|------|
| DEC-11 | G-OFF-001 | Defer HMM TVTP to V2; hmmlearn static HMM acceptable for V1 | Library change (pomegranate/pyro) is research-grade work. Static HMM still detects regimes — it just doesn't adapt sensitivity to market context. Base detection works; context-tuning is an optimization. | 2026-04-11 |
| DEC-12 | G-CMD-001 | Defer RBAC to V2 multi-user; V1 single-user has no role separation need | Only Nomaan uses V1. JWT auth locks the front door. Adding roles/guards across ~15 endpoints is medium effort for zero V1 benefit. Required before any second user is added. | 2026-04-11 |

**Pending decisions (to be resolved during execution):**

| Finding | Question |
|---------|----------|
| G-ONL-042 | Capacity planning model stays as addition; fill slippage monitoring to be implemented alongside it |
| G-OFF-015/016 | DEC-04 (defer pseudotrader post-live) is REVOKED — pseudotrader wiring is now execution priority |
